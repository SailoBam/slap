    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Long distance sailing is restricted by the necessity to course correct during travel. This requires a person to be actively steering the vessel for excessive periods of time which prevents the crew from preforming other important tasks this problem is exacerbated when sailing single-handed. Maintaining a boats course is complex, due to many factors affecting the direction of travel. This could be automated using a computer system of which corrects a boats course to a predetermined destination. This allows longer distance travels to be more accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto pilot systems have been used in marine navigation since the early 20th century, with the first patent for a marine auto pilot being filed in 1916. These early systems were mechanical and used a gyroscope to maintain a steady course. The development of electronic systems in the 1960s and 70s led to more sophisticated auto pilots that could maintain a course using electronic compass readings. Modern auto pilots range from simple mechanical systems to complex computer-controlled systems that can interface with GPS and other navigation equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of an auto pilot is to maintain a vessel's course without constant human intervention. This is particularly important for small sailing boats where crew numbers are limited. On longer passages, maintaining a constant course through manual steering is physically demanding and can lead to fatigue. This becomes especially challenging when sailing single-handed, where the sailor needs to manage multiple tasks such as navigation, sail trim, and monitoring weather conditions while also controlling the boat's direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's market offers various auto pilot solutions. More expensive systems integrate with boat's navigation systems and can cost thousands of pounds. These systems often include features like GPS tracking, wind monitoring, and the ability to follow complex routes. Simple mechanical systems like wind vanes and basic electronic auto tillers provide a more affordable solution for small boat owners, though with limited functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "This project sets out to build an Auto Tiller using ready available componants and a smart-phone. The specific problem is how a boat's heading can be controlled given the boat's steering dynamics and any distruptions to its heading from the sea, wind and tide conditions. How can such a system be developed as the development cannot be made at sea? The project also looks to find what functions can be added given the oppotunities a smart-phone presents.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have contacted two sailors who would typically use an auto pilot on their boat perticularly for long single handed passages. To understand their needs I created a questionaire and I focused on understanding requirements by asking them to describe how and when they would use an auto pilot system. The result of the questionaire have shaped this project by attempting to achieve and complete the set out objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reaserching the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different forms of auto pilot used on sailing boats. These range from electonic systems linked to the boats navigation systems through to mechanical wind vane systems. The mechanism auto pilots control the boat also varies as some driver the tiller / rudder directly and some have an auxillary powered rudder and some use a system known as trim tabs which function like ailerons on a aircraft wing. Most of these commercial systems are expensive to purchase however the basic parts for an auto tiller can be obtained inexpensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The common feature of all self steering and auto pilots is [closed loop control]. This means that the system in some way measures the difference between desired and actual boat heading. This difference must be fed back to the boats rudder in such a way that the difference is reduced. How this difference is fed to the rudders varies however most basic systems use an algorithm such as [PID] although some modern system use machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a part of gathering requirements I investigated the specification and operating instructions for a Raymarine ST1000 auto tiller. This was very helpful in undertanding the system requirements and operation.\n",

    "\n",
    "There will only be one intended user for SLAP who is the boat's skipper or helmsmen. Their role is to input the desired heading into the computer. In this regard identifing users for SLAP is somewhat simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identification of users' needs and acceptable limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify the users needs I developed a questionaire which I made available online using Google Forms. I first contacted two sailors and explained the project and then asked them to complete the questionaire. The idea behind the questionaire was to develop a [user story] which is a simple description of the user, their goal in using the system and a step by step description of how the user interacts with the system and what the system does in response to these interactions.\n",
    "\n",

    "### General User Story\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the material from the questionaire, the following general user story has been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Sam the sailor sets of on his boat alone. He motors out to open water and points his boat into the wind. He then raises his sails and bears away to start moving. He sets his course in the direction he wants to travel and he adjusts his sails to achieve a balance between the main sail and the jib such that the boat holds a steady course without significant force on the rudder. Sam relaxes and steers the boat for some time. Having satisfied himself that everything is ship shape he decides he would like to cook himself dinner. Sam has already connected the SLAP tiller actuator to his trim tabs on the rudder. He switches on the power to slap and using his mobile phone he connects to the wifi hotspot provided by SLAP. He opens a browser on his phone and enters SLAP into the address bar. He is immediatly taken the to the SLAP home page. After a few moments, SLAP obtains a GPS signal and sam can see his current heading shown on the compass rose in slap. Sam decides to log his journey and first presses the log button on SLAP which begins reading the SLAP sensors and recording them in log. Sam now presses start (Auto Pilot) and SLAP engages. SLAP now measures the boat's heading using the GPS and compares this to the heading recorded when he pressed start. SLAP now adjusts the tiller actuator in response to any error in the course. Sam waits to check the auto pilot is functioning and heads below to make his dinner. While making his curry, Sam keeps his mobile phone in view and occasionly checks the compass rose where he can see the current course, the tiller angle and the desired course. Sam can feel the boat has slowed a little because the wind has shifted slightly, Sam uses his judgment as a sailor and presses the '+1' degree button on slap three times to trim the boat to the wind. Sam takes his dinner up to the cockpit where he enjoys his meal while SLAP looks after his boat.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Sam sails through the night taken the occasional uncomfortable 15 minute nap while SLAP steers the boat. In the morning he arrives near to his destination. Sam presses stop on SLAP's interface and SLAP disengages and stops recording. Sam hands the steers the boat under the power of his engine into harbour. Sam ties up the boat and makes some coffee. Sam opens his mobile phone and connects to the harbour wifi. Sam opens SLAP and navigates to the 'Trips' table. He sees the latest trip in the list and presses upload. SLAP connects to the internet and uploads the sailing log to an online  mapping service. When complete Sam presses view on SLAP and is presented with a map view showing the course of his boat as recorded by SLAP throughout the night. Sam is a happy sailor.\"*\n",

These could include optional data such as wind direction, strength , magnetic compass (magnetometer), movements (accelerometer) depending on which sensors have been added to the SLAP system. In all cases these sensors output numerical values which are processed and stores in SLAP's log database table. Information about the users desired heading will be inputted into the system in degrees. The system needs to be easy to activate and deactivate in case of emergencies. The other inputs to the system are the configuration parameters. These are used to tune the boat control system to produce the best response for the perticular boat's characteristics.\n",

    "\n",
    "The proposed solution, SLAP, is a prototype sailing autopilot system built around a Raspberry Pi computing module. The hardware components include a GPS sensor for position and heading data, a magnetic compass for precise directional information, enviromental sensors and a servo motor system to control the tiller. The Raspberry Pi runs a Python-based control program that implements a PID control algorithm to maintain the desired heading. The software architecture includes modules for sensor data, heading calculation, control logic implementation, and data logging to an SQLite database. The system features a web-based user interface allowing sailors to set course parameters and monitor performance in real-time. All sensor readings, trip data, and system configurations are logged to enable review. A modular design will allow for easy expansion with additional sensors and future enhancements."

    "## Objectives and Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of SLAP is to provide a reliable auto-pilot system for small sailing vessels that can maintain a steady course while allowing the sailor to attend to other tasks. The system is to be contructed from available low cost components including a tiller actuator (servo motor) to interface with standard tiller actuator hardware and provide a user-friendly interface accessible via mobile devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system must implement a suitable control algorithm that can automatically adjust the tiller position based on GPS heading data to maintain the desired course. The control parameters need to be configurable to accommodate different vessel characteristics, sailing conditions and must respond to enviromental forces which change the boats heading\n",
    "\n",
    "SLAP requires a sensor system including GPS for position and heading data, and optionally additional sensors like wind direction, compass, and accelerometer. The sensor data must be logged at regular intervals for course plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enable system development and enable testing, the system must have a __simulate__ mode for boat dynamics and enviromental disturbances to the boats heading. Without this, the system is not at a prototype level where testing on a real boat can be undertaken.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user interface must be designed with large, clear controls. Key features include course display, manual course adjustment controls, and system status indicators. The interface should be web-based and accessible via WiFi connection to mobile devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive data logging system is required to store trip details, sensor readings, and system performance metrics in a structured database. The logs should be uploadable to an online mapping service for review. The database needs to support multiple trips, sensor configurations, and control parameter sets.\n"
