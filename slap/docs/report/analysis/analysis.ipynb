    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Long distance sailing is restricted by the necessity to course correct during travel. This requires a person to be actively steering the vessel for excessive periods of time which prevents the crew from preforming other important tasks this problem is exacerbated when sailing single-handed. Maintaining a boats course is complex, due to many factors affecting the direction of travel. This could be automated using a computer system of which corrects a boats course to a predetermined destination. This allows longer distance travels to be more accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto pilot systems have been used in marine navigation since the early 20th century, with the first patent for a marine auto pilot being filed in 1916. These early systems were mechanical and used a gyroscope to maintain a steady course. The development of electronic systems in the 1960s and 70s led to more sophisticated auto pilots that could maintain a course using electronic compass readings. Modern auto pilots range from simple mechanical systems to complex computer-controlled systems that can interface with GPS and other navigation equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary purpose of an auto pilot is to maintain a vessel's course without constant human intervention. This is particularly important for small sailing boats where crew numbers are limited. On longer passages, maintaining a constant course through manual steering is physically demanding and can lead to fatigue. This becomes especially challenging when sailing single-handed, where the sailor needs to manage multiple tasks such as navigation, sail trim, and monitoring weather conditions while also controlling the boat's direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's market offers various auto pilot solutions. More expensive systems integrate with boat's navigation systems and can cost thousands of pounds. These systems often include features like GPS tracking, wind monitoring, and the ability to follow complex routes. Simple mechanical systems like wind vanes and basic electronic auto tillers provide a more affordable solution for small boat owners, though with limited functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of this project was to see if an auto pilot could be constructed using low cost parts and modules, using a smart phone as an interface. There are simple basic auto pilot systems often called 'auto tillers' which are similar to this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have contacted two sailors who would typically use an auto pilot on their boat perticularly for long single handed passages. To understand their needs I created a questionaire and I focused on understanding requirements by asking them to describe how and when they would use an auto pilot system. The result of the questionaire have shaped this project by attempting to achieve and complete the set out objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Description of Current System\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different forms of auto pilot used on sailing boats. These range from electonic systems linked to the boats navigation systems through to mechanical wind vane systems. The mechanism auto pilots control the boat also varies as some driver the tiller / rudder directly and some have an auxillary powered rudder and some use a system known as trim tabs which function like ailerons on a aircraft wing. Most of these commercial systems are expensive to purchase however the basic parts for an auto tiller can be obtained inexpensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The common feature of all self steering and auto pilots is [closed loop control]. This means that the system in some way measures the difference between desired and actual boat heading. This difference must be fed back to the boats rudder in such a way that the difference is reduced. How this difference is fed to the rudders varies however most basic systems use an algorithm such as [PID] although some modern system use machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a part of gathering requirements I investigated the specification and operating instructions for a Raymarine ST1000 auto tiller. This was very helpful in undertanding the system requirements and operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Identification of users\n",
    "\n",
    "There will only be one type of intended user who is the user of the boat. Their role is to input the desired heading into the computer. In this regard identifing users for SLAP is somewhat simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identification of users' needs and acceptable limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify the users needs I developed a questionaire which I made available online using Google Forms. I first contacted my users and explained the project and then asked them to complete the questionaire. The idea behind the questionaire was to develop a [user story] which is a simple description of the user, their goal in using the system and a step by step description of how the user interacts with the system and what the system does in response to these interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The questionaire and its responses are included in appendix A.\n",
    "\n",
    "## General User Story\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the material from the questionaire, the following user story has been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Sam the sailor sets of on his boat alone. He motors out to open water and points his boat into the wind. He then raises his sails and bears away to start moving. He sets his course in the direction he wants to travel and he adjusts his sails to achieve a balance between the main sail and the jib such that the boat holds a steady course without significant force on the rudder. Sam relaxes and steers the boat for some time. Having satisfied himself that everything is ship shape he decides he would like to cook himself dinner. Sam has already connected the SLAP tiller actuator to his trim tabs on the rudder. He switches on the power to slap and using his mobile phone he connects to the wifi hotspot provided by SLAP. He opens a browser on his phone and enters SLAP into the address bar. He is immediatly taken the to the SLAP home page. After a few moments, SLAP obtains a GPS signal and sam can see his current heading shown on the compass rose in slap. Sam decides to log his journey and first presses the log button on SLAP which begins reading the SLAP sensors and recording them in log. Sam now presses start (Auto Pilot) and SLAP engages. SLAP now measures the boat's heading using the GPS and compares this to the heading recorded when he pressed start. SLAP now adjusts the tiller actuator in response to any error in the course. Sam waits to check the auto pilot is functioning and heads below to make his dinner. While making his curry, Sam keeps his mobile phone in view and occasionly checks the compass rose where he can see the current course, the tiller angle and the desired course. Sam can feel the boat has slowed a little because the wind has shifted slightly, Sam uses his judgment as a sailor and presses the '+1' degree button on slap three times to trim the boat to the wind. Sam takes his dinner up to the cockpit where he enjoys his meal while SLAP looks after his boat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sam sails through the night taken the occasional uncomfortable 15 minute nap while SLAP steers the boat. In the morning he arrives near to his destination. Sam presses stop on SLAP's interface and SLAP disengages and stops recording. Sam hands the steers the boat under the power of his engine into harbour. Sam ties up the boat and makes some coffee. Sam opens his mobile phone and connects to the harbour wifi. Sam opens SLAP and navigates to the 'Trips' table. He sees the latest trip in the list and presses upload. SLAP connects to the internet and uploads the sailing log to an online  mapping service. When complete Sam presses view on SLAP and is presented with a map view showing the course of his boat as recorded by SLAP throughout the night. Sam is a happy sailor.\"\n",

    "The story above provides a helpful guide to the users requirements. This story is broken down into use cases in the design section of this report.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user needs to be able to effectively use the software whilst under the sometimes challenging conditions found whilst making a passage so large interactive elements are important. The user is expected to be competent in basic marine navigation as the system should not be completely relied upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Sources and Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Incoming data would be from various sensors around the boat to read information about the environment and boat's condition. These could include optional data such as wind direction, strength , magnetic compass (magnetometer), movements (accelerometer) depending on which sensors have been added to the SLAP system. In all cases these sensors output numerical values which are processed and stores in SLAP's log database table. Information about the users desired heading will be inputted into the system in degrees. The system needs to be easy to activate and deactivate in case of emergencies. The other inputs to the system are the configuration parameters. These are used to tune the boat control system to produce the best response for the perticular boat's characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary output of the system is a signal to drive the tiller actuator which changes the boat's direction. This numeric value within the software must interface with the tiller actuator motor itself. The secondary outputs of the system are the information readouts presented on the SLAP user interfaces. These include the headings, the tiller position and the sensor readings. The final output from the system is a trip log showing the waypoints measured throughout the journey on a map.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential outputs may be visual representations of the systems performance including the difference between the desired course and actual course.  \n",
    "After a course has been completed, data will be inserted into a log table to then be used as reference for future use, adjustments, and performance assessments. A score could then be outputted based on the performance assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Volumes\n",
    "\n",
    "All incoming data will be read in regular intervals of approximately 2 minutes whilst the system is active. As an estimate the system would take data from a given number of sensors every second. We assume all sensors are within two bytes, however this may become larger due to the encoding of the information. As an estimate for each byte of raw data we may need ten bytes of storage. A passage of 4 days (96 hours) would then result in a 3MB log file.\n",

    "Primary Sensor Data\n",
    "\n",
    "GPS will be used to get positional data about the boat and its location relative to the desired destination using its longitude and latitude. GPS will also be used to determine approximate speed and direction using the standard NMEA format. Speed and direction will be stored as an integer value\n",
    "\n",
    "A Motion Sensor will be used to report information about the boat's movement and by extension the seas condition. It will have an integer value for each axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log files will include many different data types, such as time (integer), distance (integer)\n",

    "# Realistic Appraisal of the Feasibility of Potential Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Other solutions to this issue include a completely mechanical system which uses the wind direction to keep the boat in a steady course, however it does not consider factors about the boat and its environment and so is ineffective at keeping a course for long distances. Electronic solutions do exist however they lack a closed feedback loop meaning they cannot improve their performance over time. They also do not allow for the logging of previous trips and so the performance of the system can be difficult to measure. This system will be able to use past data from previous use to improve its performance. It will also be able to adjust course based on real time data being inputted into the system about the environment."
