    "\n",
    "The following feedback from one of the users who completed the requirements questionaire.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I have used Francis' SLAP program which I accessed via the internet on my phone. I understood that this is the same as if I was using the system on my boat. Francis gave me a short tutorial explaining how to use the system and how to engage the simulator mode.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I found the user interface easy to understand, perticularly because the functions of the system are as I would expect from other auto pilots. I used the simulator mode and then engaged the auto pilot imagining that I was the boat. I could see that the control system maintained the boat heading closely against the desired heading when the pilot is engaged. I was able to use the adjustment buttons to alter course as if I were avoiding obsticals. I was able to engage and disengage as and when needed. For example when I am tacking the boat.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I found the compass display on the phone to be a useful addition to what you would normal see on an auto pilot. The ability to create trip logs is a nice feature not seen on most auto pilots. I thought it was very impressive that the logs could be uploaded to the internet to view at home.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Overall I found the project to be impressive, and I am quite keen to have a go with the actuator really controlling the trim tabs on my boat to adjust the steering. An unexpected feature of Francis' system is the low power consumption. From my experience the problem with commercial auto pilots is that it uses too much power as they must drive the rudders directly. With this system connected to the trim tabs the system can turn the rudder with little force requiring less power improving the feasiblility of engaging the auto pilot for many hours.\""

    "| 1 | Maintain a steady course within ±5 degrees using a closed-loop control algorithm | The PID controller successfully maintained the course within ±5 degrees in the simulate mode. To fully test the system, SLAP would need to be tested on boat with the servo motor connected to the tillers. The simulation mode is expected to be somewhat representitive of the real system as it includes both the boat dynamics and disturbances. | Visually monitored the system for 10 minutes, making occasional changes to the heading and observing the rudder making the appropiate changes in response to disturbances. | Partial |\n",
    "| 2 | Provide manual parameter tuning interface allowing configuration of the control system | The system as developed has the ability to create and select a set of configuration setting for the PID algorithm, different configurations could be created for different conditions. The user is able to select which configuration is used when the auto pilot is in run mode | Simple manual tests, these can be seen in the Testing section | Complete |\n",
    "| 3 | Maintain autonomous control for a minimum duration of 10 minutes | The evaluation for this objective was undertaken with the same method as objective 1 | Extended simulator testing sessions conducted | Complete |\n",
    "| 4 | Provide a simulation feature to enable development of a prototype to be tested on real boat. The simulator was utilised throughout the tests and realistic turning behaviour was observed. | The simulator mode with its underlying boat dynamics modelling has proven successful and allowed development to take place to the point where the next stages would involve tesing on a real boat | The method was to evaluated through automated and manual | Complete |\n",
    "| 5 | Implement a web interface with large touch controls and information displays | The web interface was tested on a mobile phone and the information display and buttons were found to be usable. The overall user expierence would be suitable for real world testing | Manual verification of use of user interfaces, images of the interface are shown throughout the Testing section | Complete |\n",
    "| 6 | Log GPS positions (waypoints) for the boat's trips | The GPS unit was able to obtain saterlite signals and the logitude and latitude signals were shown in the sensor display and recorded in the trip log. In simulate mode, trip logs were also generated. Trip logs were successfully uploaded to MapBox. | SLAP was operated outside where saterlite reception was possible and trip logs were created. | Complete |\n",
    "| 7 | Store trip data including start/end times in a trips table | The method was testing as decribed above. | As above | Complete |\n",
    "| 8 | Include all the features described in the user journey | All features mentioned in the journey have been evaluated and tested and proven to be operational. | The entire Testing section tests each feature of the journey | Complete |\n"
