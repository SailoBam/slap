    "\"I have used francis' SLAP program which I accessed via the internet on my phone. I understood that this is the same as if I was using the system on my boat. Francis gave me a short tutorial explaining how to use the system and how to engage the simulator mode.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\" I found the user interface easy to understand, perticularly because the functions of the system are as I would expect from other auto pilots. I used the simulator mode and then engaged the auto pilot imagining that I was the boat. I could see that the control system maintained the boat heading closely against the desired heading when the pilot is engaged. I was able to use the adjustment buttons to alter course as if I were avoiding obsticals. I was able to engage and disengage as and when needed. For example when I am tacking the boat.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I found the compass display on the phone to be a useful addition to what you would normal see on an auto pilot. The ability to create trip logs is a nice feature not seen on most auto pilots. I thought it was very impressive that the logs could be uploaded to the internet to view at home.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Overall I found the project to be impressive, and I am quite keen to have a go with the actuator really controlling the trim tabs on my boat to adjust the steering. An unexpected feature of francis' system is the low power consumption. From my experience the problem with commercial auto pilots is that it uses too much power as they must drive the rudders directly. With this system connected to the trim tabs the system can turn the rudder with little force requiring less power improving its feasiblility to engage the auto pilot for many hours.\""

Once using the autopilot I would be keeping an eye on the course from time to time. If the wind changed, I would need to alter the sails and the pilot to stay on course.

    "- Maintain a steady course using a closed loop control system\n",
    "- Allow for manual tuning during travel, allowing for adjustment of angle to be made based on a compass bearing\n",
    "- Steer the boat for at least 10 minutes allowing for other tasks to be preformed\n",
    "- The user interface must be accessible for all users no matter the conditions on sea including angle adjustment and course viewing\n",
    "- Performance of the system must be logged allowing for review\n",
    "- A database should be used to store log data with entries for each individual passage made\n",
    "- To be able to use the user interface to plot a passage from a map display\n",
    "- The system must be able to automatically adjust its course in real time based on data input"
