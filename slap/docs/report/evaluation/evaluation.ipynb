    "\n",
    "\"I have used Francis' SLAP program which I accessed via the internet on my phone. I understood that this is the same as if I was using the system on my boat. Francis gave me a short tutorial explaining how to use the system and how to engage the simulator mode.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I found the user interface easy to understand, perticularly because the functions of the system are as I would expect from other auto pilots. I used the simulator mode and then engaged the auto pilot imagining that I was the boat. I could see that the control system maintained the boat heading closely against the desired heading when the pilot is engaged. I was able to use the adjustment buttons to alter course as if I were avoiding obsticals. I was able to engage and disengage as and when needed. For example when I am tacking the boat.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I found the compass display on the phone to be a useful addition to what you would normal see on an auto pilot. The ability to create trip logs is a nice feature not seen on most auto pilots. I thought it was very impressive that the logs could be uploaded to the internet to view at home.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Overall I found the project to be impressive, and I am quite keen to have a go with the actuator really controlling the trim tabs on my boat to adjust the steering. An unexpected feature of Francis' system is the low power consumption. From my experience the problem with commercial auto pilots is that it uses too much power as they must drive the rudders directly. With this system connected to the trim tabs the system can turn the rudder with little force requiring less power improving the feasiblility of engaging the auto pilot for many hours.\""
