      "source": "Self Logging Auto Pilot (SLAP) is my AQA A Level NEA completed in 2025. The aim of this project is to develop a prototype real-time control system using low cost componentsm, featuring elements of software, robotics and electronics. The project has been an oppotunity to write a larger software system and gain experience of many programming techniques and to overcome the challenges that the project presented.\n\nThe choice of this project was driven by my interests in sailing and real world control systems. I have also built a number of Python projects using Rasberry Pi and various hardware modules in the past. I have experience of hand steering a sailing boat for long periods at night. The project shares many aspects of aerospace engineering which I aim pursue in future. The project has been a successful learning experience and has included a number of difficult problems which took many hours of work to overcome.\n\nMy approach to this project has been one of iterative development. I started the development work by creating experiments in python to test and understand the various parts of the system individually. These can be found in project files submitted along with this report. After this early work, I created Iteration0, this being the first version of SLAP. Each time realised the code needed restructuring I created new iteration. In the final iteration (Iteration2), I found the structure worked well enough to complete the project.\n\nOne particular problem in this project is that it has not been possible to fully test the auto pilot on a sailing boat due to the season. To solve this problem this project included the computer modelling of boat steering dynamics. This allowed me to test my control system without the need of the physical boat. The other advantage of the building the simulator was that I developed a better understanding of the problem. The development of SLAP is both about meeting the user's needs but also about developing a real time closed loop control system.\n\nThroughout the development I used the Git source code repository to manage versions of my code and enable me to roll back my code when problems spiraled. I used a combination of manual testing and unit testing to ensure the functionality and I used a task list to manage my progress. My brother introduced me to jupyter notes which I have used to make this report. This was very useful as I can implement code and images into the report. I used Visual Studio Code for all the development of SLAP."

This requires a person to be actively steering the vessel for excessive periods of time which prevents the crew from preforming other important tasks. This problem is exacerbated when sailing single-handed. Maintaining a boats course is complex, due to many factors affecting the direction of travel. This could be automated using a computer system of which corrects a boats course to a predetermined heading. This allows longer distance travels to be more accessible.\n\nAuto pilot systems have been used in marine navigation since the early 20th century. These early systems were mechanical and used a gyroscope to maintain the heading. The development of electronic systems led to more sophisticated auto pilots that could maintain a course using electronic compass readings. Modern auto pilots range from simple mechanical systems to complex computer-controlled systems that can interface with GPS and other navigation equipment.\n\nThe primary purpose of an auto pilot is to maintain a vessel's course without constant human intervention. This is particularly important for small sailing boats where crew numbers are limited. On longer passages, maintaining a constant course through manual steering is physically demanding and can lead to fatigue. This becomes especially challenging when sailing single-handed, perticularly at night, where the sailor needs to manage multiple tasks such as navigation, sail trim, and monitoring weather conditions while also controlling the boat's direction.\n\nToday's market offers various auto pilot solutions. More expensive systems integrate with boat's navigation systems and can cost thousands of pounds. These systems often include features like GPS tracking, wind monitoring, and the ability to follow complex routes. Simple mechanical systems like wind vanes and basic electronic auto tillers provide a more affordable solution for small boat owners, though with limited functionality.\n\n## Problem Statement\nThis project sets out to build an Auto Tiller using ready available componants and a smart-phone. The specific problem is how a boat's heading can be controlled given the boat's steering dynamics and any distruptions to its heading from the sea, wind and tide conditions. How can such a system be developed as the development cannot take place at sea? The project also looks to find what functions can be added, given the oppotunities a smart-phone presents.\n\nI have contacted two sailors who would typically use an auto pilot on their boat perticularly for long single handed passages. To understand their needs I created a questionaire and I focused on understanding requirements by asking them to describe how and when they would use an auto pilot system. The result of the questionaire helped define the project by requirements and objectives.\n\n## Reaserching the problem\n\nThere are many different [forms of auto pilot](https://www.raymarine.com/en-gb/learning/online-guides/what-are-the-different-types-of-boat-autopilot) used on sailing boats. These range from electonic systems linked to the boats navigation systems through to mechanical wind vane systems. The mechanism auto pilots control the boat also varies as some driver the tiller / rudder directly and some have an auxillary powered rudder and some use a system known as trim tabs which function like ailerons on a aircraft wing. Most of these commercial systems are expensive to purchase however the basic parts for an auto tiller can be obtained inexpensively.\n\nThe common feature of all self steering and auto pilots is a closed loop control. This means that the system in some way measures the difference between desired and actual boat heading. This difference must be fed back to the boats rudder in such a way that the difference is reduced.\n\nAs a part of gathering requirements I investigated the specification and operating instructions for a [Raymarine ST1000](https://raymarine.manymanuals.com/unknown/st1000-plus/specifications-1759/download) auto tiller. This was very helpful in undertanding the system requirements and operation.\n\n### RayMarine ST1000\n![st1000](images/image_34_st1000.jpeg)\n\n### Summary of functions\n\nUsing the ST1000 Manual, the following functions were identified\n\n**Navigation**\n\n**Start / Stop** User presses start or stop button, system engage / disengage auto pilot control\n\n**Adjust** The user presses one of the course increment buttons, system increments current target angle by buttons value\n\n**Configuration**\n\n**Mode** User presses change mode button, system cycles through the 4 configuration modes\n\n**Calibration** The user cycles through options to correct menu and uses increment buttons to change value, sytem saves changed setting and maintain calibration\n\n\n## Identification of Users\n\nThere will only be one intended user for SLAP who is the boat's skipper or helmsmen. Their role is to input the desired heading into the computer. In this regard identifing users for SLAP is somewhat simple.\n\n### Identification of users' needs\n\nTo identify the users needs I developed a questionaire which I made available online using Google Forms. I first contacted two sailors and explained the project and then asked them to complete the questionaire. The idea behind the questionaire was to develop a description of the *users journey* which is a simple description of the user, their goal in using the system and a step by step description of how the user interacts with the system and what the system does in response to these interactions.\n\nThe questionaire and its responses are included in appendix A.\n\n### General User Journey\n\nUsing the material from the questionaire, the following general user story has been created. This helped define what SLAP is for and how it should work.\n\n*\"Sam the sailor sets of on his boat alone. He motors out to open water and points his boat into the wind. He then raises his sails and bears away to start sailing. He sets his course in the direction he wants to travel and he adjusts his sails to achieve a balance between the main sail and the jib such that the boat holds a steady course without significant force on the rudder. Sam relaxes and steers the boat for some time. Having satisfied himself that everything is ship shape he decides he would like to cook himself dinner. Sam has already connected the SLAP tiller actuator to his [trim tabs](https://www.pbo.co.uk/reviews/gear/hebridean-wind-vane-testing-the-diy-self-steering-gear) on the rudder. He switches on the power to SLAP and using his mobile phone he connects to the wifi hotspot provided by SLAP. He opens a browser on his phone and enters SLAP into the address bar. He is immediatly taken the to the SLAP home page. After a few moments, SLAP obtains a GPS signal and Sam can see his current heading shown on the compass rose in SLAP. Sam decides to log his journey and first presses the log button on SLAP which begins reading the SLAP sensors and recording them in the log. Sam now presses start (Auto Pilot) and SLAP engages. SLAP now measures the boat's heading using the GPS and compares this to the heading recorded when he pressed start. SLAP now adjusts the tiller actuator in response to any error in the course. Sam waits to check the auto pilot is functioning and heads below to make his dinner. While making his curry, Sam keeps his mobile phone in view and occasionly checks the compass rose where he can see the current course, the tiller angle and the desired course. Sam can feel the boat has slowed a little because the wind has shifted slightly, Sam uses his judgment as a sailor and presses the '+1' degree button on SLAP three times to trim the boat to the wind. Sam takes his dinner up to the cockpit where he enjoys his meal while SLAP looks after his boat.*\n\n*Sam sails through the night taken the occasional uncomfortable 15 minute nap while SLAP steers the boat. In the morning he arrives near to his destination. Sam presses stop on SLAP's interface and SLAP disengages and stops recording. Sam hand steers the boat under the power of his engine into harbour. Sam ties up the boat and makes some coffee. Sam opens his mobile phone and connects to the harbour wifi. Sam opens SLAP and navigates to the 'Trips' table. He sees the latest trip in the list and presses upload. SLAP connects to the internet and uploads the sailing log to an online  mapping service. When complete Sam presses view on SLAP and is presented with a map view showing the course of his boat as recorded by SLAP throughout the night.*\n\n*Sam is a happy sailor.\"*\n\nThe story above provides a helpful guide to the users requirements. This story is broken down into required features in the design section of this report. These required features can then define a substantial part of the testing.\n\n## Modelling the Problem\n\nAs a part of the analysis, research was necessary to identify a suitable control algorithm.\n\n**Closed Loop Control**\n- The rocket problem\n- PID Control example\n- Informing the design\n- Disturbances\n\n\n**Rocket Test**\n\nTo do this I created a Rocket Simulation, this was simply an object which is accelerated down by gravity and pushed up by a limited thrust.\nI first investigated the [PID algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxXKJXRHthk), which tries keep the Rocket at a specified height.

This analysis informs the design section.\n\n### Data Sources and Outputs\n\n\n\nIncoming data would be from various sensors around the boat that provide information about the environment and boat's condition. These could include optional data such as wind direction, strength , magnetic compass (magnetometer), movements (accelerometer) depending on which sensors have been added to the SLAP system. In all cases these sensors output numerical values which are processed and stored in SLAP's log database table. Information about the user's desired heading will be inputted into the system in degrees. The system needs to be easy to activate and deactivate in case of emergencies. The other inputs to the system are the configuration parameters. These are used to tune the boat control system to produce the best response for the particular boat's characteristics.\n\nThe primary output of the system is a signal to drive a tiller actuator which changes the boat's direction. This numeric value within the software must interface with the tiller actuator motor itself. The secondary outputs of the system are the information readouts presented on the SLAP user interfaces. These include the headings, the tiller position and the sensor readings. The final output from the system is a trip log showing the waypoints measured throughout the journey on a map.\n\n\n### Data Volumes\n\nAll incoming data will be read in regular intervals of approximately 2 minutes whilst the system is active. As an estimate, if we assume all sensors values are within ten bytes, then a passage of 4 days (96 hours) would then result in a 288KB log file. However we should assume the storage and encoding of this data would require ten times this space. And therefore an estimate for this might need 3MB of storage. This would be easily accomidated on most modern computer systems.\n\n### Data Dictionary\n\n**Primary Sensor Data**\n\nA GPS will be used to get positional data about the boat as two strings, these being its longitude and latitude. The GPS will also be used to determine speed and direction which will be stored as float values.\n\nA Motion Sensor will be used to report information about the boat's movement and by extension the sea condition stored as float values for each axis.\n\nLog files will include many different data types from the sensors and the time when there readings were taken. This will be stored as a DateTime\n\n**Data Collection**\n\nCurrent Time will be stored for each read of each sensor.\n\nPositions along the boats course (waypoints) will be stored as a change in longitude and latitude strings.\n\n\n\n### Data Flow Diagram\n\n![dfd](images/image_8_dfd.drawio.png)\n\n\nThe diagram shows an analysis of the necessary data flows in the system. It shows how the user's desired heading is compared with the GPS sensor heading and the difference is fed into the control algorithm. The configuration parameters are used by the control algorithm to set the tiller position. The boat responds and changes its course which is fed back via the GPS (as it reads the new heading). \n\n\n### System Database Entities\n\nThe analysis of the requirements results in the design of an outline database as follows:\n\n\nConfig Table:\n\n- Contains parameters used to tune the control algorithm\n\n- Each parameter has a name, value and description\n\n- Parameters such as the controller configuration values\n\n- Multiple config sets can be stored for different conditions\n\nSensors Table:\n\n- Maintains a list of all sensors connected to the system\n\n- Each sensor has a unique ID, name, type and calibration data\n\n- Sensor types include GPS, compass, wind speed/direction, accelerometer etc.\n\nTrips Table:\n\n- Records details of each sailing trip/passage\n\n- Contains start/end times, start/end locations\n\n- Stores target heading and actual course taken\n\n- Links to config settings used for that trip\n\nReadings Table:\n\n- Stores all sensor readings during trips\n\n- Each reading links to a specific trip and sensor\n\n- Includes timestamps and raw sensor values\n\nThe database structure and an entity relationship diagram are included in the Design section."

The system is to be contructed from available low cost components and provides a user-friendly interface accessible via a smart phone.\n\nThe system must implement a suitable control algorithm that can automatically adjust the tiller position based on GPS heading data to maintain the desired course. The control parameters need to be configurable to accommodate different vessel characteristics, sailing conditions and must respond to enviromental forces which change the boats heading\n\nSLAP requires a sensor system including GPS for position and heading data, and optionally additional sensors like wind direction, compass, accelerometer, temperature and atmospheric pressure. The sensor data must be logged at regular intervals for course plotting.\n\nTo enable system development and testing, the system must have a Simulate Mode for boat dynamics and enviromental disturbances to the boats heading.

The system consists of several interconnected modules that work together to meet the system requirements and project objectives.\n\nAt its core, the system uses a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control algorithm that continuously monitors the boat's heading and makes adjustments to maintain the desired course. This is accomplished via a GPS sensor for postition and heading data. Additional sensors to detect sea and enviromental conditions. The sensor data and tiller adjustments are processed in real-time.\n\nThe user interface is implemented as a web application, allowing sailors to interact with the system through any mobile device with a web browser. This interface provides visualisation of key data like current heading whilst also allowing manual control inputs when needed. Communications between the web app and the smart phone is uses the RP5 WiFi HotSpot and a HTTP based communications.\n\nData logging is a key feature of the system, with detailed records of each journey stored in a database. The logs capture all sensor readings, including GPS position, motion sensor data, and heading. The logged data can be uploaded to a cloud based mapping application.\n\nThe system is designed to be reliable, it operates autonomously while still giving the sailor full control when needed.\n"

The webserver module, running MicroPython on an Rasberry Pi handles communication between the user interface and control systems. A dedicated PID module executes the main feedback control loop, receiving setpoint adjustments from the webserver when manual changes are made.\n\nThe design presented below was the result of a number of development iterations. The code for earlier iterations is included with the files submitted with this project\n\n**Modular Design Diagram:**\n\n![modularDesign](images/image_46_modularDesign.drawio.png)\n\n\n## Module Descriptions and Interconnections\n\nThe SLAP system consists of modules that work together to provide automated steering control. Each module has specific responsibilities and functions. I have tried to make sure that related responsibilities have not been split between modules. The modules are described below. The code in the Technical Solution section is organised along the lines of these modules.\n\n### Auto Pilot Module\n- **PID Controller**: The central control module that implements the proportional-integral-derivative control algorithm\n- **Input**: Current heading, desired heading, sensor data\n- **Output**: Rudder position commands\n- **Interfaces**: \n  - Recieves GPS data\n  - Receives target heading updates from Web Interface\n  - Sends control commands to Tiller Actuator\n\n### Boat Dynamics Simulator Module\n- **Components**: Virtual Boat Dynamics, Disturbances, Simulated geographic position calculations\n- **Responsibilities**: For testing purposes by mimicking the behaviour of a boat\n- **Interfaces**:\n  - Recieves rudder angle\n  - Calculates new heading and position\n  - Provides simulated heading and position to GPS Module (in Sim Mode)\n\n### Sensor Register Module\n- **Components**: GPS, Motion Sensors, Eviroment Sensors\n- **Responsibilities**: A register of all the hardware transducer modules and the sensors that they contain\n- **Interfaces**:\n  - Sends sensor data to Auto Pilot Controller\n  - Keeps the GPS module updated\n  - Provides data to Logging Module\n  - Communicates with Web Interface for display\n\n### GPS Module\n- **Components**: Register of GPS values\n- **Responsibilities**: To provide information about the boats position and heading\n- **Interfaces**:\n  - Collects data from either a GPS Hardware Module, the Magnetometer or the boat simulator\n  - Supplies modules which require heading and positional data\n\n### Tiller Actuator Module\n- **Components**: Servo Motor Controller\n- **Responsibilities**: Converts the tiller angle into signals for the servo motor\n- **Interfaces**:\n  - Receives tiller angle signal from PID Controller interface\n  - Provides feedback to Web Interface\n\n### Web Interface Module\n- **Components**: Web Server, Javascripts, HTML Template for each page, style sheets\n- **Responsibilities**: User interaction for system control and monitoring\n- **Interfaces**:\n  - Sends manual control inputs to Auto Pilot\n  - Receives data from all sensors\n  - Displays system status\n\n### Logger Module\n- **Components**: Data Logger\n- **Responsibilities**: Collecting data and writing to database\n- **Interfaces**:\n  - Receives data from all sensors\n  - Talks to SlapStore database service to store logs\n\n### SlapStore Module\n- **Components**: Database connection, Table Definitions, Storage Service Layer\n- **Responsibilities**: Reading and writing to the database, keeping the database details hidden from the rest of the program\n- **Interfaces**:\n  - Connection to [SQLite database](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/sqlite/sqlite_python.htm)\n  - Storage services for all parts of the system\n\n### Mapping Module\n- **Components**: Map Manager, Cloud interfacing\n- **Responsibilities**: Read log data and write to the cloud mapping service\n- **Interfaces**:\n  - Receives data from SlapStore service layer\n  - Talks to MapBox to upload trip logs\n\n### Real-Time Behaviour\nIn early versions of SLAP, it proved too difficult to make the system function properly with a single program loop where each component is run in sequence. Therefore the system makes use of a number of execution threads. Early experimental code into threads can be found in the files submitted with the project. Each component which needs to execute in its own loop is given a dedicated thread. The choice of which modules required a thread was based on when a module needs to function in real-time.\n\nThe threaded modules are:\n- Boat sim\n- All sensors\n- Logger\n- Web server\n\n\n### Communication Flow\n1. The Sensor Modules continuously collects data\n2. The Auto Pilot receives heading data from Sensors and calculates control values using the PID module\n3. The Actuator Module recieves the control values from the Auto Pilot and controls the servo motor\n4. The Logging Module records all sensor data at regular time interval\n5. The Web Interface recieves user interactions, displays system status and sensor values\n6. The Web Server, recieves interactions from the interface and sends them to the system modules\n7. The Map Manager takes the Trip Log and uploadts it to the cloud mapping system\n"

      "source": "\n## Algorithms\n\nThere are some key algorithms within the system which required some design. The control algorithm was first investigated as part of the Analysis section. These algorithms are explained in detail below.\n\n### Boat Simulator\n\nThe boat simulator allows SLAP to run without the need of a real boat, this is necessary for test and development purposes, and understanding the boat dynamics and creating modelling code is a key part of the project. Without the simulator the objective of a prototype system ready for testing on a real boat cannot be met.\n\nThere are two element to the boat simulator.The first is the mathmatical model which represents the boats response to the tiller. This is characterised by calculating the new heading using the previous information about the boats heading. The dynamics of this turning behaviour are that the boat begins to turn quickly, as the boat turns its rate of turn slows until a steady rate is reached. This is a [first order differential response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLktwqbgUXE). i.e. the rate of change of turn is proportional to the difference (differential) between the current and eventual rate of turn. \n\nThe second element of the boat modeling is the disturbances to the boats heading due to the enviroment. The boat simulator would not be realistic without this as the control algorithm would simply and quickly achieve the correct heading. The boat simulator model therefore randomly generates disturbances which affects the boats heading and forces the Auto Pilot control algorithm to react.\n\n**Mathmatics**\n\nIn order to control the movement and direction of the boat we must first be able to model how the rudders angle affects the boats direction.\n\nWe understand that the rudders angle and boat's direction do not respect a linear relationship, if we represent the rudder's angle with $\\theta$, and the turning radius of the boat as $R$ we can see that: $R = \\frac{1}{K |\\theta|}$ where $K$ is some constant .\n\nThis inversely proptional relationship is proven as we know as the rudders angle increases, the turning radius decreases. The rate of which the boats heading changes, also known as the angular velocity, $\\omega$, can be represented as the differential of the angle and time: $\\frac{dA}{dt}$ or as the velocity over the radius: $\\frac{v}{R}$.\n\nTherefore $\\omega = \\frac{v}{(K|\\theta|)^{-1}}$, and so: $$\\omega = vK|\\theta|$$\n\nWe can simply intergrate this to find the change in angle over time to give : $$\\Delta\\omega = vK|\\theta|t$$\n\nHowever we understand that the boat does not turn to the target radius immediately, there is always some lag between turning the rudder and the target radius being reached.\n\n\nThe turn rate follows an exponential decay until it reaches the target, the standard decay equation is $N_{t+1} = N_{t} - e^{-\\lambda t}$\n\nWhere lambda is our decay constant and $t$ is our discrete time value.\n\n\nThis can be implemented with our boat applicable values: $$\\omega(t) = \\omega_{\\infty} \\left( 1 - e^{-t/\\tau} \\right)$$\n\nBelow is a simplified diagram of this mathmatics:\n\n![boatcourse](images/image_17_boatCoursePath.drawio.png)\n\nThis algorithm is implemented in code as descibed in the Technical Solution section(boatSim.py)\n\n**Disturbances**\n\nThe disturbance algorithm randomly picks a start time by using the current time and adding a random value. Its duration is determined by repeating this process but using the start time. When a disturbance is inflicted on the simulator its rate of turn is increased or decreased by a random magnitude. All random values are determined within a realistic range to mimic the affect of sea conditions on a boat.\n\nThe following code shows the disturbance algorithms:"

Early versions of the code included development of these algorithms.

If the system were connected to the internet, during operation, the risk would be significant. However, on a boat with SLAP connected to a smart phone via a WiFi HotSpot the oppotunity for an unorthorised user to access the system is very small. This is because access is controlled by the WiFi security on the RPi5 HotSpot.\n\n\n## Testing Strategy\n\n\nThe testing strategy for SLAP involves both manual and unit testing approaches. The testing strategy is designed to ensure the system includes all features and meets the specific project objectives.\n\n### Manual Testing\nManual testing will be conducted to verify the physical operation of the system. This includes:\n\n- Testing the tiller control mechanism\n\n- Verifying compass readings\n\n- Checking the user interface functionality\n\n### Unit Testing\nUnit tests will be developed for each major component of the system\n\n\n### General Feature Testing\nEach identified function from the Analysis section will be tested\n\n\n### Project Objectives Testing\nThe testing strategy ensures all project objectives are met.\n\n\n"

This section details the implementation of this design (Technical Solution). The code for SLAP is carefully structured inline with the modular design. To aid understanding, the diagram below is repeated from the Design section as it provides an index to the code. The diagram has a close correspondance to the code structure. This technical solution section explains the system's architecture and each module.\n\n![figure1: Slap Architecture](images/image_23_systemArchitecture.drawio.png)\n\n### Modes of Operation\n\nSLAP has two modes of operation:\n\n In **Simulator Mode** the boat's dynamics (how the boat's heading changes over time in response to the tiller action) is mathmatically modelled.\n \n In **Run Mode** the tiller actuator affects the boat's heading according to the actual characteristics of the boat which is reflected in the GPS readout.\n \nThe diagram above illustrates how the system switches between these modes. The controller, in turn, links the tiller actuator to the GPS via a PID controller system. A database is used to store the system's configuration and to act as a logger recording the detail of each trip."

      "source": "## Overview\nThe following sections describe each module in outline, full details of their operation and coding are then provided below.\n\n### Web Browser\nThis is the user interface which is the web browser on the user's smartphone. The user connects to the local WiFi HotSpot on the boat, provided by the Rasberry Pi where the SLAP system is running.\n\n### Web Server\nIn early experiments, the Web Server was coded using python functions for HTTP handling. See the code submitted with the project to see web server programmed using Python functions (web/experiments folder). This was complex and required a lot of code. In the final iteration, the Web Server code is built using the Flask Python library. This allows HTTP EndPoints to be more easily coded. The Web Server includes has two primary functions. The first is to serve HTML pages and the second is to provide HTTP endpoints.\n\n### Auto Pilot\nThis is the central coordinating module in the system. It recieves heading data in real time from the GPS, which is forwarded into the PID controller. The output of the PID then drives the tiller actuator module. The controller includes the Proportional, Integral and Differential (PID) feedback system. This PID controller attempts to adjust the boat's heading to minimise the difference between the actual heading and the target heading as set by the skipper.\n\n### GPS\nThe GPS module is a real time system providing a continous update of the boats heading. In 'Sim Mode' the GPS module returns a heading provided by the Boat Dynamics Simulator module, rather than the actual GPS. The GPS module gets data from actual GPS hardware via the Sensor Register, which contains a sensor linked to the hardware GPS\n\n### Tiller Actuator\nThis module recieves tiller angle settings from the PID controller and activates a connected servo motor to drive the tiller. In Simulator Mode this module drives the boat dynamics simulator. The tiller servo motor uses a PWM (Pulse Width Modulated) signal to set the motors position.\n\n### Boat Dynamics Simulator\nThis module is used in Simulator Mode to represent the boat's behavour. It is based on the heading changing in response to the tiller action. The mathmatics of this model is based on a first order differential equation and is detailed in the Design section.\n\n### SLAP Store\nThis module is a service interface which interacts with the database. The store is responsible for persisting the system configuration and for logging details of the boat's track (a set of waypoints). The SlapStore module provides an set of methods for the other system modules to use. It hide all database details such as database connections and SQL complexity.\n\n### Sensor Register\nThe Sensor Register is a module which provides access to a list of sensors within the system. The register is filled with objects of the class Tranducer, each containing their sensors. The Sensor Register provides methods to access all sensor details within the system.\n\nThe Sensor Register and its related classes use object oriented code patterns including abstract classes and inheritance. This pattern is explained in the Design section.\n\n### Map Manager\nThis module is responsible for uploading Trip logs to the [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/webinars/mapbox-python-anvil) cloud based mapping system. It takes data from the logging module, converts it to JSON, connects to MapBox via a HTTP interface, authenticates with the service and makes an upload.\n\n### Logger\nThe logger module is responsible for writing the latest system data to the database at regular intervals. It runs in its own thread and interacts with the SlapStore to write logs to the database.\n\n## Threading and Module Interaction\nThe following diagram and descriptions represent the interaction between the key modules in the system. It also illustrates which modules run in their own dedicated threads. These diagrams read alongside the system architecture diagram is key to understanding the code and its operation.\n\n### Sensor Register\n\nThe diagram below shows how the main.py firstly creates the Sensor Register, then adds the transducers which in turn creates and their sensors. When the sensor register is run, it runs each Transducer in a new thread. These threads continously obtains values from the Transducers hardware and sets the values on each of its sensors. This is shown in the sequence diagram below.\n\nThe diagram shows an example of the sequence for one Transducer. The pattern repeats for all Transducers\n\n![slapSequenceStartUp](images/image_25_sensorRegisterSequence.drawio.png)\n\n### Main Program Entry Point\nThe main.py first builds the Sensor Register as described above. It then contructs each of the SLAP modules. These being TillerActuator, AutoPilot, Gps, BoatSim, MapManager, Logger and SlapStore.\nThese modules are then wired together as seen in the System Architecture diagram by passing references to a module into each module it is connected to. The main finally creats and starts the Web Server in a seperate thread."

This module maps between the database tables and python classes representing rows within the database. The design pattern of this package is known as a [Service Fascade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern). The purpose of this package is to provide the methods the program requires whilst hiding the complexity and implementation of the database from the rest of the program.\n"

I understood that this is the same as if I was using the system on my boat. Francis gave me a short tutorial explaining how to use the system and how to engage the simulator mode.\"\n\n\"I found the user interface easy to understand, perticularly because the functions of the system are as I would expect from other auto pilots. I used the simulator mode and then engaged the auto pilot imagining that I was the boat. I could see that the control system maintained the boat heading closely against the desired heading when the pilot is engaged. I was able to use the adjustment buttons to alter course as if I were avoiding obsticals. I was able to engage and disengage as and when needed. For example when I am tacking the boat.\"\n\n\"I found the compass display on the phone to be a useful addition to what you would normal see on an auto pilot. The ability to create trip logs is a nice feature not seen on most auto pilots. I thought it was very impressive that the logs could be uploaded to the internet to view at home.\"\n\n\"Overall I found the project to be impressive, and I am quite keen to have a go with the actuator really controlling the trim tabs on my boat to adjust the steering. An unexpected feature of Francis' system is the low power consumption. From my experience the problem with commercial auto pilots is that it uses too much power as they must drive the rudders directly. With this system connected to the trim tabs the system can turn the rudder with little force requiring less power improving the feasiblility of engaging the auto pilot for many hours.\""

The systems basic functions are the same as many existing auto tiller systems. This design will utilise low cost parts and make use of a mobile phone, and a GPS module to achieve a high functioning system.\n\nThis questionnaire is designed to identify user requirements for an auto pilot system. The questions have been designed to avoid suggesting how the system would function are more about understanding the users true needs.\n\n\n## Background Information\n\n**Q1:** \nPlease outline your general sailing background and experience.\n\n**A1:**\n\n-Sailed around the world. Sailing all my life.\n\n-20+ years skipper small sailing yachts\n\n**Q2:** \nPlease could you describe the type of boat that you have and outline its steer mechanisms.\n\n**A2:**\n\n-Tiki 30 catamaran. Transom hung rudders with tillers and link bar.\n\n-Catamaran, two rudders, two tillers connected by a cross bar\n\n**Q3:** \nPlease describe the different types of journeys you make on your boat.\n\n**A3:**\n\n-Lots of weekend trips along the coast and some longer trips for a couple of weeks to Ireland, Scillies, Channel Islands.\n\n-Coastal trips typically ranging up to 50 nautical miles.\n\n## Questions\n\n**Q1:**\nImagine that you are on a passage. Please outline in a simple story form what you would be doing on your boat leading up to the use of an auto pilot system. How and why you might interact with the autopilot during the passage, and what would you expect to happen when you finish using the system?\n\n**A1:**\n\n-Hand steering the boat onto the desired course and trimming the sails ready to balance the boat to engage the autopilot. Once using the autopilot I would be keeping an eye on the course from time to time. If the wind changed, I would need to alter the sails and the pilot to stay on course. When finishing I want a quick way of disconnecting it.\n\n-Get the boat sailing on required course with sails trimmed accordingly. Switch on autopilot to continue on desired course. Might need to interact with autopilot to avoid obstacles ahead eg other boats, buoys etc. Once clear of an obstruction set autopilot back on desired course. If I need to change direction, eg rounding a headland then I would adjust the course again using the controls on the autopilot. If I have to tack, I would put the autopilot on standby and once settled on the new tack, give control back to the autopilot. Once arrived at my destination I would switch the autopilot off and put it away.\n\n**Q2:**\nHave you experienced using any autopilot systems in the past, and if so please can you say which products you have used and outline their basic operation. If possible please describe the strengths and weaknesses of these systems.\n\n**A2:**\n\n-Raymarine St60 system with chain drive motor to wheel sprocket. The system is on standby and when you want it to steer you push the auto button. Once engaged you can fine tune the course with + - 1 or 10 increments. The strengths is an accurate course, the downside is a large current consumption.\n\n-Simrad tiller pilot.\n\nSwitch between on and standby.\n\nWhen on, can adjust course being steered using +1, +10, -1, -10 buttons.\n\nIt is quite easy to use and is compact in size.\n\nIt's is quite power hungry, perhaps drawing 5 amps.\n\nTo work on my catamaran it needs additional mechanisms eg long push/pull rod\n\n\n**Q3:**\nWhat do you believe are the key features of an autopilot are? Can you identify any important failings which I should be aware of? \n\n**A3:**\n\n-Key features are being able to adjust course easily to avoid fish pots, vessels etc and quick disconnect in an emergency. System must be able to be tuned to the sea state. Little helm adjustments when calm or going to windward or large adjustments when rough and going downwind.\n\n-To steer accurately\n\nTo be robust in a harsh environment\n\nTo be easy to use.\n\n**Q4:**\nUsing previous autopilot systems, how often did you need to adjust the system, and why, in order to maintain effective travel?\n\n**A4:**\n\n-Autopilots steer to a compass course, so if the wind alters you often need to adjust the pilot. So perhaps every 2 - 3 hours at sea. If going along the coast you need to adjust the pilot regularly to navigate around headlands, fish pots, vessels.\n\n-Hardly ever needs adjustment once set up.\n\n**Q5:**\nWhat adjustments would you expect to make to the system as it is running?\n\n**A5:**\n\n-Sea state, so amount of helm used each pilot movement. Sensitivity, if the boat is a design that steers straight or one that turns very quickly, sensitivity to being off course is good to adjust.\n\n-As described previously, to avoid obstacles ahead.\n\n**Q6:**\nGiven that the system is dependant on a GPS, there is  an opportunity to incorporate features from other devices which utilise a GPS such as a trip logger / tracker, can you suggest what features from these devices would be most beneficial if integrated into the auto pilot?\n\n**A6:**\n\n-Some autopilot systems can be integrated with a chartplotter so that it will steer a passage of multiple courses and programmed to change to a new course once a waypoint has been achieved. I'm a bit wary of too much automation. It's better to have the skipper navigating in partnership with the autopilot.\n\n-Trip logger could save using a smart phone to do that job\n"
