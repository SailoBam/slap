    "## Overall System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The SLAP (Self Logging Auto Pilot) system is designed to provide automated steering control for small sailing vessels while maintaining detailed logs of each journey. The system consists of several interconnected modules that work together to meet the system requirements and project objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, the system uses a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control algorithm that continuously monitors the boat's heading and makes adjustments to maintain the desired course. This is accomplished via a GPS sensor for postition and heading data. Additional sensors to detect sea and enviromental conditions. The sensor data and tiller adjustments are processed in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user interface is implemented as a web application, allowing sailors to interact with the system through any mobile device with a web browser. This interface provides visualisation of key data like current heading whilst also allowing manual control inputs when needed. Communications between the web app and the smart phone is uses the RP5 WiFi HotSpot and a HTTP based communications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data logging is a key feature of the system, with detailed records of each journey stored in a database. The logs capture all sensor readings, including GPS position, motion sensor data, and heading. The logged data can be uploaded to a cloud based mapping application.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is designed to be reliable, it operates autonomously while still giving the sailor full control when needed.\n"

    "The boat simulator allows SLAP to run without the need of a real boat, this is necessary for test and development purposes, and understanding the boat dynamics and creating modelling code is a key part of the project. Without the simulator the objective of a prototype system ready for testing on a real boat cannot be met.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two element to the boat simulator.The first is the mathmatical model which represents the boats response to the tiller. This is characterised by calculating the new heading using the previous information about the boats heading. The dynamics of this turning behaviour are that the boat begins to turn quickly, as the boat turns its rate of turn slows until a steady rate is reached. This is a [first order differential response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLktwqbgUXE. i.e. the rate of change of turn is proportional to the difference (differential) between the current and eventual rate of turn. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second element of the boat modeling is the disturbances to the boats heading due to the enviroment. The boat simulator would not be realistic without this as the control algorithm would simply and quickly achieve the correct heading. The boat simulator model therefore randomly generates disturbances which affects the boats heading and forces the Auto Pilot control algorithm to react.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathmatics**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to control the movement and direction of the boat we must first be able to model how the rudders angle affects the boats direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We understand that the rudders angle and boat's direction do not respect a linear relationship, if we represent the rudder's angle with $\\theta$, and the turning radius of the boat as $R$ we can see that: $R = \\frac{1}{K |\\theta|}$ where $K$ is some constant .\n",
    "\n",
    "This inversely proptional relationship is proven as we know as the rudders angle increases, the turning radius decreases. The rate of which the boats heading changes, also known as the angular velocity, $\\omega$, can be represented as the differential of the angle and time: $\\frac{dA}{dt}$ or as the velocity over the radius: $\\frac{v}{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore $\\omega = \\frac{v}{(K|\\theta|)^{-1}}$, and so: $$\\omega = vK|\\theta|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can simply intergrate this to find the change in angle over time to give : $$\\Delta\\omega = vK|\\theta|t$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However we understand that the boat does not turn to the target radius immediately, there is always some lag between turning the rudder and the target radius being reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The turn rate follows an exponential decay until it reaches the target, the standard decay equation is $N_{t+1} = N_{t} - e^{-\\lambda t}$\n",

    "\n",
    "There are complications in the arithmatic relating to compass headings. This is due to the fact a compass functions on a 360 degree basis. For example the difference between a heading of 5 degrees and 355 degrees should be -10 degrees and 355 degrees + 10 degrees must equal 5 degrees not 365 degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "When calculating which way to adjust the tiller as a part of the control algorithm, this arthmetic complication is important otherwise the boat will attempt to correct its course the wrong way around. The algorithms for these calculations are shown in the code snippets below.\n",

    "It took some time to get the system to work due to these complications. Early versions of the code included development of these algorithms. These versions can be found in the file submitted for this project\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic approach to dealing with compass headings is to use modulo 360 arithmetic. Secondly when calculating differences for control we must find the smallest change in heading necessary."

    "\n",

    "The second threat identified is inappropiate access to the system. If the system were connected to the internet, during operation, the risk would be significant. However, on a boat with SLAP connected to a smart phone via a WiFi HotSpot the oppotunity for an unorthorised user to access the system is very small. This is because access is controlled by the WiFi security on the RPi5 HotSpot.\n",
