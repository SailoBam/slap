    "\n",
    "## Overall System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The SLAP (Self Logging Auto Pilot) system is designed to provide automated steering control for small sailing vessels while maintaining detailed logs of each journey. The system consists of several interconnected components that work together to achieve reliable navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, the system uses a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control loop that continuously monitors the boat's heading and makes adjustments to maintain the desired course. This is accomplished through a group of sensors including GPS for position and speed data, and motion sensors to detect the boat's movement and sea conditions. The sensor data is processed in real-time to calculate necessary rudder adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user interface is implemented as a web application built with Flask, allowing sailors to interact with the system through any mobile device or computer with a web browser. This interface provides visualisation of key data like current heading, speed, and wind conditions, whilst also allowing manual control inputs when needed. The web application communicates with a rasberry pi based webserver over a local WiFi connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data logging is a key feature of the system, with detailed records of each journey stored in a cloud database. The logs capture comprehensive sensor readings, including GPS coordinates, speed, motion sensor data, and control adjustments. This historical data can be viewed visually on a map\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is designed to be reliable, it operates autonomously while still giving the sailor full control when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modular Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The system architecture follows a modular design approach, with separate components handling specific functions. The webserver module, running MicroPython on an Rasberry Pi or similar microcontroller, manages the file system and handles communication between the user interface and control systems. A dedicated PID module executes the main feedback control loop, receiving setpoint adjustments from the webserver when manual changes are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system will be split into multiple smaller modules, a webserver running micro-python on an Arduino (or similar) will host a file system to store the user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client (Phone) will run the interface and send requests the webserver upon button press. The client will also be sending a �rest call� to update the GUI constantly over Wi-Fi.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user interface will be written in JavaScript with React to run a HTML web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "A separate PID module will be running custom code which preforms the main feedback loop, the webserver will communicate to this module to execute manual changes by sending a set point position.\n",

    "A central value gives the angle of the target heading in degrees between 0 and 359. Central at the bottom is a set button which begins the Auto Pilot which will try to keep the boat on course. Another button will start the logging. The stop button will stop the Auto Pilot control loop. The simulate button will engage the boat sim. Manual adjustments can be made with the buttons at the top, allowing for both fine and broad adjustments. The menu button in the top left will give you access to the other pages.\n",

    "## Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections details the two central algorithms implemented in SLAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boat Simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "The boat simulator allows SLAP to run without the need of a real boat, this is necessary for test and development purposes, and understanding the boat dynamics and creating modelling code is a key part of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two element to the boat simulator.The first is the mathmatical model which represents the boats response to the tiller. This is characterised by calculating the new heading using all the previous information about the boats heading. The dynamics of this turning behaviour are that the boat begins to turn quickly, as the boat turns its rate of turn slows until a steady rate is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second element of the boat modeling is the disturbances to the boats heading. The boat simulator would not be realistic as the control algorithm would simply and quickly achieve the correct heading. The boat simulator model randomly generates disturbances which affects the boats heading and forces the Auto Pilot to react.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathmatics\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to control the movement and direction of the boat we must first be able to model how the rudders angle affects the boats direction\n",
    "\n",
    "We understand that the rudders angle and boats direction do not respect a linear relationship, if we represent the rudder's angle with $\\theta$, and the turning radius of the boat with R we can see that: $R = \\frac{1}{K |\\theta|} $\n",
    "\n",
    "This inversely proptional relationship is proven as we know as the rudders angle increases, the turning radius decreases. The rate of which the boats heading changes, also known as the angular velocity, $\\omega$, can be represented as the differential of the angle and time: $\\frac{dA}{dt}$ or as the velocity over the radius: $\\frac{v}{R}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore $\\omega = \\frac{v}{(K|\\theta|)^-1}$, and so: $$\\omega = vK|\\theta|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can simply intergrate this to find the change in angle over time to give : $$ \\Delta\\omega = vK|\\theta|t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "However we understand that the boat does not turn to the target radius immediately, there is always some lag between turning the rudder and the target radius being reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The turn rate follows an exponential decay until it reaches the target, the standard decay equation is $ N_{t+1} = N_{t} - e^{-\\lambda t} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Where lambda is our decay constant and t is our discrete time value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be implemented with our boat applicable values: $$ \\omega(t) = \\omega_{\\infty} \\left( 1 - e^{-t/\\tau} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm is built into the code as descibed in the technical solution (boatSim.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Psuedo Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The following psuedo code discrete time approximation of the boats response to the tiller:\n",
    "\n",
    "[PSUEDO CODE GOES HERE]\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disturbances\n",
    "\n",
    "The disturbance code randomly picks a start time based on the current time by adding a random value. Its duration is determined by repeating this process on the start time. When a disturbance is inflicted on the simulator its rate of turn is increased or decreased by a random magnitude. All random values are determined within a realistic range to mimic the affect of sea conditions on a boat.\n",
