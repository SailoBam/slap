    "## Overall System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The SLAP (Self Logging Auto Pilot) system is designed to provide automated steering control for small sailing vessels while maintaining detailed logs of each journey. The system consists of several interconnected components that work together to achieve reliable navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core, the system uses a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control loop that continuously monitors the boat's heading and makes adjustments to maintain the desired course. This is accomplished through a group of sensors including GPS for position and speed data, and motion sensors to detect the boat's movement and sea conditions. The sensor data is processed in real-time to calculate necessary rudder adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user interface is implemented as a web application built with Flask, allowing sailors to interact with the system through any mobile device or computer with a web browser. This interface provides visualisation of key data like current heading, speed, and wind conditions, whilst also allowing manual control inputs when needed. The web application communicates with a rasberry pi based webserver over a local WiFi connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system architecture follows a modular design approach, with separate components handling specific functions. The webserver module, running MicroPython on an Rasberry Pi or similar microcontroller, manages the file system and handles communication between the user interface and control systems. A dedicated PID module executes the main feedback control loop, receiving setpoint adjustments from the webserver when manual changes are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data logging is a key feature of the system, with detailed records of each journey stored in a cloud database. The logs capture comprehensive sensor readings, including GPS coordinates, speed, motion sensor data, and control adjustments. This historical data can be viewed visually on a map\n",
    "The system is designed to be robust and reliable, with fail-safes and manual override capabilities to ensure safety. It operates autonomously while still giving the sailor full control when needed, making it a valuable tool for both recreational sailing and training purposes.\n",

    "## Modular Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The system will be split into multiple smaller modules, a webserver running micro-python on an Arduino (or similar) will host a file system to store the user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client (Phone) will run the interface and send requests the webserver upon button press. The client will also be sending a �rest call� to update the GUI constantly over Wi-Fi.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user interface will be written in JavaScript with React to run a HTML web application.\n",
    "\n",
    "A separate PID module will be running custom code which preforms the main feedback loop, the webserver will communicate to this module to execute manual changes by sending a set point position.\n",

    "Primary Sensor Data\n",
    "\n",
    "GPS will be used to get positional data about the boat and its location relative to the desired destination using its longitude and latitude. GPS will also be used to determine approximate speed and direction using the standard NMEA format. Speed and direction will be stored as a decimal value\n",
    "\n",
    "A Motion Sensor will be used to report information about the boat's movement and by extension the seas condition. It will possess a decimal value for each axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log files will include many different data types, such as time (integer) and distance (integer) and error value which will be stored as a decimal value (float)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Current Time will be stored for each reading of each sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The destination will be retrieved from the user and stored as a longitude and latitude coordinate (integers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Actual course will be stored as a change in longitude and latitude (integers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Desired course will be stored as a change in longitude and latitude (integers) from start position to desired destination.\n",

    "Actuator value will be stored as an integer value.\n",

    "Central value gives the angle of the heading in degrees between 0 and 359. Speed is given in knots at the top left with the time in the top right. Central at the bottom is a set button which begins the program which will try to keep the boat on course, this will also start the elapsed running time and will begin to count. The stop button will cancel the program and will reset the timer. Manual adjustments can be made with the buttons at the bottom, allowing for both fine and broad adjustments. The map button gives access to the map interface.\n",
