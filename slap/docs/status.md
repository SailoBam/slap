# Technical Solution

## 1. Boat Simulation Model
    Simple motion dynamics example - working
    Simple boat dynamics example - 
    boat dymanic maths - (almost done)
TODO: 

    Code boat simulator module (this must genertate heading as a function of time in response to rudder angle)
    
## 2. PID Controller
    PID Module - working
    Tester which runs it with the rocket simulation - working
TODO:

    Run PID module against boat dynamics
## 3. Web App
    Basic web server with PUSH, PUT, POST functions -Working
    Basic HTML page with javascript button - Working
    Can serve a file - Working
    Design iteration 0 of web page - Includes current direction, set direction, up and down button - Working
    Basic web app with images and rotation svg according to angle - working
TODO:

    Design iteration 1 of web app - This will include all bells and whistles including start/stop, record buttons, time

## 4. NMEA Reader
    NMEA Writer (Angle) - working
    NMEA Writer (Position) - working
    NMEA Test (Angle, Position) - working

## 5. Database
    basic database function library - working
    basic database design drawing - complete
TODO:

    Finalise database design 
    Create database initialisation script
    Finish database service layer (slapStore)

## 6. Cloud Interface (For Database)
TODO:

    Decide on which cloud service to use e.g strava etc
    Create rest service
    Create Tests
    Develop upload code

## 7. Application Framework
    Created basic threading tests inlcuding using a simple web server one thread (without PID) - Working
TODO:

    Create worker threads for PID and seperated web server
    Intergrate the PID boat simulator into a multi-threaded application
    Intergrate PID output to drive servo motor

## X. Motor Driver
TODO:

    Investigate basics of servo motor control
    Buy suitable motor and controller
    Build basic 3D printed mount
    Write motor driver Code
