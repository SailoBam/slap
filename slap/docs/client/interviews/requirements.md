## Introduction
The SLAP project is to design and build a self steering auto pilot for a sailing boat. The systems basic functions are the same as many existing auto tiller systems. This design will utilise low cost parts and make use of a mobile phone, and a GPS module to achieve a high functioning system.

This questionnaire is designed to identify user requirements for an auto pilot system. The questions have been designed to avoid suggesting how the system would function are more about understanding the users true needs.


### Background Information

#### Q1
Please outline your general sailing background and experience.

#### Q2 
Please could you describe the type of boat that you have and outline its steer mechanisms.

#### Q3 
Please describe the different types of journeys you make on your boat.

### Questions

#### Q1
Imagine that you are on a passage. Please outline in a simple story form what you would be doing on your boat leading up to the use of an auto pilot system. How and why you might interact with the autopilot during the passage, and what would you expect to happen when you finish using the system?

#### Q2
Have you experienced using any autopilot systems in the past, and if so please can you say which products you have used and outline their basic operation. If possible please describe the strengths and weaknesses of these systems.

#### Q3
What do you believe are the key features of an autopilot are? Can you identify any important failings which I should be aware of? 

#### Q4
Using previous autopilot systems, how often did you need to adjust the system, and why, in order to maintain effective travel?

#### Q5
What adjustments would you expect to make to the system as it is running?

#### Q6
Given that the system is dependant on a GPS, there is  an opportunity to incorporate features from other devices which utilise a GPS such as a trip logger / tracker, can you suggest what features from these devices would be most beneficial if integrated into the auto pilot?
